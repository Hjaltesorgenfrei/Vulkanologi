Learning Vulkan from <https://vulkan-tutorial.com>, while trying to keep it as clean and modern c++ as possible.

## Compiling on Windows

## TODO

- [ ] Move Model Matrix into push constant, but leave proj and view in UBO
- [ ] Finish chapters of Vulkan-Tutorial
- [ ] Load more objects
  - [ ] Introduce VMA, VK-Guide has a tutorial for this. Else the buffer management is too complex
